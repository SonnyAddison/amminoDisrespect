# Ammino Disrespect
Allows for the user to select a body focused body part that they want new exercises for.  After selecting the body part, excersises with descriptions will show so that the user will know how to conduct the excersise, allowing them to incorperate it into their workout plan.

On the nutrition page titled "Feed the Beast" the user can then enter a food item and then the nutritional value will be displayed so that they can obtain full caloric intake and micronutrian values.
